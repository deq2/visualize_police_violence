  DE-ESCALATION
  Policing requires that at times an officer must exercise control of a violent or resisting subject to make an arrest, or to protect the officer, other officers, or members of the community from risk of imminent harm. Clearly, not every potential violent confrontation can be de-escalated, but officers do have the ability to impact the direction and the outcome of many situations they handle, based on their decision-making and the tactics they choose to employ.
  When reasonable under the totality of circumstances, officers should gather information about the incident, assess the risks, assemble resources, attempt to slow momentum, and communicate and coordinate a response. In their interaction with subjects, officers should use advisements, warnings, verbal persuasion, and other tactics and alternatives to higher levels of force. Officers should recognize that they may withdraw to a position that is tactically more secure or allows them greater distance in order to consider or deploy a greater variety of Force Options. Officers shall perform their work in a manner that avoids unduly jeopardizing their own safety or the safety of others through poor tactical decisions.",0,"No.

Officers should ensure that they do not engage in unreasonable actions that precipitate the use of force as a result of tactical, strategic, and procedural errors that place themselves or others in jeopardy. The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments, in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving, about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation. The reasonableness inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one; the question is whether the officersƒÉ√ç actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation."" p. 105-1
  ""STATE STATUTES
  a. C.R.S. _18-1-707 states in the pertinent part: Use of physical force in making an arrest or in preventing an escape:
  1. ""(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a peace officer is justified in using reasonable and appropriate physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he reasonably believes it necessary:
  a. To effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of an arrested person unless he knows that the arrest is unauthorized; or
  b. To defend him self or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force while effecting or attempting to affect such an arrest or while preventing or attempting to prevent such an escape.
  2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person for a purpose specified in subsection (1) of this section only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary:
  a. To defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or
  b. To affect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes:
  1. Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon; or
  2. Is attempting to escape by the use of a deadly weapon; or
  3. Otherwise indicates, except through a motor vehicle violation, that he is likely to endanger human life or to inflict serious bodily injury to another unless apprehended without delay. (The Denver Police Department policy on use of deadly force in this situation is more restrictive than state law _ see OMS 105.05(5).
  ...
  4. For the purposes of this section a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense means a reasonable belief in facts or circumstances which if true would in law constitute an offense. If the believed facts and circumstances would not in law constitute an offense, an erroneous though not unreasonable belief that the law is otherwise does not render justifiable the use of force to make an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody. A peace officer who is affecting an arrest pursuant to a warrant is justified in using the physical force prescribed in subsection (1) and (2) of this section unless the warrant is invalid and is known by the officer to be invalid.""
  b. The community expects and the Denver Police Department requires that peace officers use only the force necessary to perform their duties. The level of force applied must reflect the totality of circumstances surrounding the immediate situation. The officer need only select a level of force that is necessary and within the range of _objectively reasonable options.

Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
 Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:

 Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
 (a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she
 reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
 (b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable
 cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony
 involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and
 the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury
 or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under
 such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where
 feasible.
 Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist
 even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For
 example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the
 following:
 1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to

 Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
 (a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she
 reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
 (b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable
 cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony
 involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and
 the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury
 or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under
 such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where
 feasible.
 Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist
 even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For
 example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the
 following:
 1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to
 believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
 2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon
 and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""",0,No use of force continuum found in Police Department Policy Manual.,https://www.oxnardpd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Oxnard-Police-Department-Policy-Manual.pdf,https://www.oxnard.org/city-department/human-resources/mou-information/,,,,0.5,69%,0.0,,19%,74%,,0%,,,167.2,23%,71%,55%,,,,,1.8,,1.8,54%,63%,61%,49%,47%,$337.54,23%,6%,19%,-10%,7%,1,0,200,212,212,200,207,207,27,29,25,27,31,32,107

Force - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents, or weapons to another

• Hold - the grasping of the clothing, body, or body part for the purpose of gaining control of,
restraining, or moving a person who is not cooperative.
• Control Hold (also"" Pain Compliance"") - application of pressure using specific techniques
to specific body parts for the purpose of preventing a person's movement or controlling
movement in a particular direction or to overcome resistance on his/her part.
• Strike - use of hands (including fists), elbows, knees, targeting specific areas of a person's
body to stun, force release of grasp or stiffening, enabling an officer to gain control of a
person or stop static or assaultive resistance on his/her part.
• Baton - use of a collapsible, standard, or side-handled baton or, if used in a similar manner,
a flashlight, kubiton, etc., to strike. Use of a baton as a control hold is still considered a
""control hold.""
• Kinetic Projectile - use of projectile rounds such as shotgun-deployed beanbags, foam
or hard dowels, etc.
• Taser - use of a device which delivers electrical energy by using compressed air to fire two
probes from a detachable cartridge. Intended to temporarily incapacitate or stun a person.
• K-9 - The deployment of a K-9 dog which results in a physical contact with the suspect.
• Deadly Force - Force reasonably anticipated and intended to create a substantial likelihood
of causing death or very serious injury.
Resistance - A person does not voluntarily comply with officer instructions or commands.
Resistance may be:
• Passive - A person's non-compliance with an officer's commands that do not rise to the
level of static resistance (example: refusing to turn around for searching/handcuffing when
advised to do so) but not otherwise physically resisting an officer's efforts to physically guide
him/her.
• Static - A person refuses to comply by balking, freezing/stiffening, becoming dead weight,
and/or by grasping a solid, anchored object or structure, or another person.
• Active - A person resists by pulling away from an officer's grasp or hold, attempting to
escape, pinning his/her arms under own body to prevent handcuffing, deliberate hiding or
concealment, running away, etc.
• Assaultive - A person is aggressive or combative; threatens, attempts, or actually assaults
an officer by pushing, striking, punching, biting, kicking, etc.
• Life Threatening - A person takes or threatens any action likely to result in the serious injury

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she
reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable
cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony
involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and
the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury
or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under
such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where
feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist
even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For
example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the
following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to
believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon
and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""",0,No use of force continuum found in Police Department Policy Manual.,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lzxrtUvSaFzptb2Uh3MIxiUx-qyED26V,https://www.roseville.ca.us/hr/media/mou/rpa.pdf,50,59.9,50%,0.0,100%,,,25%,83%,50%,,,,88.2,63%,100%,23%,,,,,3.1,,3.1,28%,85%,59%,72%,81%,$277.99,44%,1%,6%,-3%,0%,1,0,116,112,120,117,116,111,6,7,8,8,9,11,187

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.

Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

An officer is authorized, but not required, to use deadly force when it appears reasonable:
(a) To protect himself or others from what he reasonably believes to be an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) To prevent the escape and affect the arrest of a felon where the officer has reasonable cause to believe the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to himself or others.
120.2 LEGALITIES
California State law provides that an officer may use deadly force:
(a) To protect his own life or that of another.
(b) To prevent the escape of one who has committed or attempted to commit a forcible felony which involves the infliction or threatened infliction of great bodily harm or is
attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon or otherwise indicates that he will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless arrested without delay.
The law regarding the use of deadly force remains the same in an active shooter incident. However, an active shooter is engaged in a continuing forcible felony, and the time frame for the
use of deadly force against him continues until the suspect discards his weapons and surrenders or is incapacitated.

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

""300.4 DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended.

Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.

Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

301.1.1
(b) Officers are permitted to use whatever force that is reasonable and necessary to affect an arrest, to protect others, or to protect themselves from bodily harm, but no more. The purpose of this policy is not to restrict officers from using sufficient force to accomplish their police mission or protect themselves, but to provide force options based upon the ""Use-of-Force Continuum"". If exceptional circumstances occur which are not contemplated by this order, officers should use any such force as in necessary to protect themselves or others. thereafter, however, they must be able to articulate the reasons for such use of force.
301.2.1 TACTICS
(c) In using the use of force continuum, it is important to remember that once the level of force used has succeeded in gaining compliance, officers should re-evaluate the force necessary to complete their task. Just as an officer may immediately increase the level of force necessary, he/she needs to be just as cognizant of decreasing levels of force when appropriate. 
301.7 UNNECESSARY FORCE DEFINED
Unnecessary force is the physical abuse of person(s) being arrested or detained, or when it is apparent that the type of degree of force employed was neither necessary nor appropriate. When any degree of force is utilized as summary punishment or for vengeance, it is clearly improper and unlawful.
300.4 DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.""",1,"Yes. Use of Force continuum included in:
(b) Officer response options.
1. Professional presence, verbalization - Includes display of authority as a peace officer and such non-verbal means of communication as body language, demeanor, and manner of approach. Verbalization means giving verbal directions and commands to the subject.
2. Restraining and detaining - Includes an officer using his/her hands to control the subject. Example include the use of a firm grip, escort position, holding down the subject and wrist lock type controls. Also included would be the application of temporary restraining devices such as handcuffs and leg restraints.
3. Compliance techniques - Includes joint manipulations, pressure point application, take-down-type techniques, and physical distraction type techniques to effect an arrest.
4. Chemical Agents - Includes mace and oleoresin capsicum based products. 
5. Intermediate force - Includes upper body control holds, such as the carotid control hold; impact weapons in an impact mode, the use of hands, feet, elbows, and knees to strike the subject, use of a Taser device or kinetic energy projectiles.
6. Lethal force - Includes the use of a firearm or any force that has a reasonable likelihood of causing death or serious physical harm.

(c) In using the use of force continuum, it is important to remember that once the level of force used has succeeded in gaining compliance, officers should re-evaluate the force necessary to complete their task.

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

- Explaining any actions about to be taken

- Recognizing that a subject’s remarks are not a personal attack

309.9 TRAINING (CED)
The Training Coordinator should ensure that all training includes: (f) De-escalation techniques.
418.4 CONSIDERATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Any officer handling a call involving an individual who may qualify for a 5150 commitment should consider, as time and circumstances reasonably permit:
(c) Conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques.
467.5 FIRST RESPONDERS
Safety is a priority for first responders. It is important to recognize that individuals under the influence of alcohol, drugs or both may exhibit symptoms that are similar to those of a person in a mental health crisis. These individuals may still present a serious threat to officers; such a threat should be addressed with reasonable tactics. Nothing in this policy shall be construed to limit an officer’s authority to use reasonable force when interacting with a person in crisis.
An officer responding to a call involving a person in crisis should:
(b) Request available backup officers and specialized resources as deemed necessary and, if it is reasonably believed that the person is in a crisis situation, use conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques to stabilize the incident as appropriate.
467.6 DE-ESCALATION
Officers should consider that taking no action or passively monitoring the situation may be the most reasonable response to a mental health crisis.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ktChgZ8KfdFVhjVUHfL5mCRhVMdwI-XK,,,,,3.4,22%,0.0,,5%,33%,21%,0%,0%,5%,52.7,64%,45%,77%,7.5,42%,4.7,2%,1.0,3.0,2.0,46%,30%,34%,24%,38%,$404.99,27%,,,,,1,0,254,269,258,254,277,279,22,21,22,20,22,23,3401

Policy Language: 300.4 DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) A deputy may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/shereasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) A deputy may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probablecause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felonyinvolving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, andthe officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injuryor death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, wherefeasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may existeven if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. Forexample, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of thefollowing:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable tobelieve the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weaponand it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) A deputy may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/shereasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) A deputy may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probablecause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felonyinvolving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, andthe officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injuryor death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, wherefeasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may existeven if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. Forexample, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of thefollowing:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable tobelieve the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weaponand it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

To affect the arrest or prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect if the deputy has reasonable cause to believe that the suspect has committed a felony and that the crime for which the suspect is wanted involved the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, and the suspect reasonably appears to pose a threat of death or serious bodily injury to the deputy or others; or,",0,"Category: Has Use of Force Continuum

While various levels of force exist, each deputy is expected to respond with only that level of force which
reasonably appears appropriate under the circumstances at the time to successfully accomplish a
legitimate law enforcement purpose in accordance with this policy. This order does not require deputies to
consider one type of force before escalating to another. The individual circumstance of each incident
dictates the level of force to be used. Nothing in this order shall prevent a deputy from using whatever force
or means is necessary in the defense of his/her life or the life of another person. Listed below are force
options authorized for use by sheriff’s personnel.
• Physical control holds which include joint manipulations, pressure point application, and take down
techniques.
• Oleoresin Capsicum Agent (OC) and /or Mace (CN). (See GO 04-01).

Policy Language: 300.4 DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) A deputy may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/shereasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) A deputy may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probablecause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felonyinvolving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, andthe officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injuryor death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, wherefeasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may existeven if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. Forexample, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of thefollowing:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable tobelieve the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weaponand it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""

Policy Language: 300.4 DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) A deputy may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/shereasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) A deputy may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probablecause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felonyinvolving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, andthe officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injuryor death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, wherefeasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may existeven if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. Forexample, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of thefollowing:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable tobelieve the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weaponand it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""""",0,"Category: Has Use of Force Continuum

City Policy: Sheriff's Department Policy Manual
Impact on Police Accountability: Does not require officers to use reasonable alternatives before using deadly force. Instead, Department Policy allows officers to use deadly force whenever they ""reasonably"" believe there to be an imminent threat, even if reasonable alternatives such as non-lethal force could have been effectively used instead.
Policy Language: 7. Lethal Force: Includes the use of a firearm or any force which has a reasonable likelihood of causing death or grave physical harm.
a. Deputies are expected to use reasonable and informed professional judgment when making decisions about the use of lethal force, remaining aware that lethal force is the last alternative.
b. Lethal force should only be considered in situations presenting a grave threat to the public or the deputy when absolute and immediate tactics must be deployed to stop the lethal threat and secure conclusive compliance and control.
c. The decision to use lethal force can only be justified by the facts or information known to the deputy when the decision to use lethal force is made. Facts unknown to the deputy, no matter how compelling, cannot be considered later in determining whether the use of lethal force was justified.
d. Lethal force may justifiably be used by deputies in the performance of their official duties under the following circumstances and after all other reasonable means of apprehension and control have failed, or where such other means reasonably appear to be ineffectual:
e. In the necessary defense of themselves or a third person from what they reasonably believe to be the use or imminent use of lethal force.
f. To effect the arrest, to prevent an escape, or to recapture an escapee when the deputy reasonably believes the subject has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use, or threatened use, of a lethal force, and when the deputy reasonably believes that a substantial risk exists that the felony suspect to be arrested will cause death or grave physical harm if apprehension is delayed.
3. 1) 6. Responsibility for Use of Firearm: The use of firearms or lethal force has the potential of resulting in a homicide. For the homicide to be justifiable, the deputy must show there was no other reasonable alternative under the circumstances. Each individual has the full responsibility of determining when he is justified in using a firearm or force likely to produce great bodilyharm.
3. 1) 4. Authorized Discharge of Firearms: All members of this Office may discharge their
firearms under the following conditions:
d. To affect an arrest when all other means have failed of a felony suspect(s) when: 1. The crime for which the arrest is sought involved conduct that included the use or threatened use of deadly force, and 2. There is a substantial risk that the person whose arrest is being sought will cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension is delayed.",1,"Category: Has Use of Force Continuum

Impact on Police Violence: Department has a Use of Force Continuum. 
Policy Language:
SECTION 4 Use of Force
2). Use of Force Continuum: A use of force continuum is a visual representation of force options designed to facilitate an understanding of appropriate levels of force by deputies. This is accomplished by establishing parameters which exhibit the actions of both the subject and the deputy on a comparative scale. A force continuum by design should be consistent with the approved written Use of Force Policy of the Office, and should be easily understood and readily recalled by deputies under the stress of the confrontation. It is also valuable as a training aid in preparing for situations which may require the use of force.
Situation-Based Use of Force Continuum
The attached use of force continuum (See Appendix A) is designed to provide an overview and visual representation of the force options available to deputies in this Office. It is a flexible instrument which attempts to embody the dynamics of a confrontation.",,,,,,2.6,25%,0.0,,30%,86%,,,,33%,149.3,20%,20%,87%,9.2,32%,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,69%,43%,47%,69%,24%,$600.28,14%,,,,,1,0,88,91,88,83,84,86,17,17,23,22,22,21,4043

Policy Language: 301.4 DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) A deputy may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/shereasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) A deputy may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probablecause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felonyinvolving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, andthe officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injuryor death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, wherefeasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may existeven if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. Forexample, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of thefollowing:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable tobelieve the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weaponand it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""""",0,"Category: Has Use of Force Continuum

Policy Language: 300.4 (b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended.

City Policy: Sheriff's Department Policy Manual 
Impact on Police Violence: Allows officers to shoot at moving vehicles even when the vehicle itself is considered the only threat. The <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/01/moving-targets-police-shootings-vehicles-the-counted> federal government, activists and even law enforcement groups have recommended that this practice be banned because it endangers lives.
Policy Language: 300.4.1 SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES Shots fired at a moving vehicle are rarely effective. Deputies, when feasible, should move out of the path of an approaching vehicle instead of positioning themselves in a position where they may be at risk from moving vehicle, thus avoiding the discharging of firearms at the vehicle or any of its occupants. A deputy should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the deputy reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the deputy or others.",0,"Category: Requires Comprehensive Use of Force Reporting

City Policy: Sheriff's Department Policy Manual
Impact on Police Accountability: Does not require officers to use reasonable alternatives before using deadly force. Instead, Department Policy allows officers to use deadly force whenever they ""reasonably"" believe there to be an imminent threat, even if reasonable alternatives such as non-lethal force could have been effectively used instead.
Policy Language: 300.4 DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) A deputy may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/shereasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) A deputy may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probablecause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felonyinvolving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, andthe officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injuryor death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, wherefeasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may existeven if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. Forexample, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of thefollowing:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable tobelieve the person intends to use it against the officer or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weaponand it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.""
300.3USE OF FORCE Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts and circumstances perceived by the officer at the time of the eventto accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose.
""
300.3 USE OF FORCE Deputies shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts and circumstances perceived by the deputy at the time of the event to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose.",0,"Category: Has Use of Force Continuum

Deputies should move out of the path of an approaching vehicle instead of discharging their firearm at the vehicle or any of its occupants. A deputy should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the deputy reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the deputy or others. Deputies should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle",0,"Category: Requires Comprehensive Use of Force Reporting

Policy Language: Officers not required to report when they point a firearm at a civilian.",0,"Category: Requires Exhaust Reasonable Alternatives Before Shooting
City Policy: Sheriff's Department Policy Manual
Impact on Police Accountability: Does not require officers to use reasonable alternatives before using deadly force. Instead, Department Policy allows officers to use deadly force whenever they ""reasonably"" believe there to be an imminent threat, even if reasonable alternatives such as non-lethal force could have been effectively used instead.
Policy Language: Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:
(a) A deputy may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she
reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.
(b) A deputy may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the deputy has probable
cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony
involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and
the deputy reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury
or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where
feasible.
Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist
even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For
example, an imminent danger may exist if a deputy reasonably believes any of the
following:
1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to
believe the person intends to use it against the deputy or another.
2. The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon
and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.",0,"Category: Has Use of Force Continuum
